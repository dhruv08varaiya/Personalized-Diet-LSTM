        2.  **It Remembers Sequences**: It specifically looks at the *sequence* of your last three meals, not just one meal in isolation. For example, it might learn that a light breakfast and a medium lunch often lead to a heavier dinner.
        3.  **It Predicts the Future**: Based on the sequence you provide, it makes an educated guess on the calories for your *next* meal.
